**Scadable** is the first fully container‑native SCADA platform—built on Kubernetes & NATS and delivered with Python +
React SDKs.
Forget rigid vendor UIs: craft your own dashboards, deploy in any cloud, and scale to millions of tags in minutes.

## Getting Started

Assuming that you have a supported version of Python installed, you can first set up your environment with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
...
. .venv/bin/activate
```

or

```commandline
python -m venv .venv
...
".venv/Scripts/activate"
```

Then, you can install Scadable from PyPI with:

```commandline
python -m pip install scadable
```

## Running Tests

You can run tests in your environment by running the `pytest` command directly:

```commandline
pytest tests
```
